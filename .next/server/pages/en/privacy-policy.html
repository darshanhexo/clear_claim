For example, depending on the platform or service we may collect your name, educational details, professional details, account ID number, login email address, physical address etc. Those platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs. The information we receive depends on what information you (via your privacy settings) or the platform or service decide to give us.

De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.</li><li><strong>To Power Social Media Features</strong>: The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Share) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature.

We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.</li><li><strong>For Security and Legal Compliance</strong>: We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:<ul><li>Permitted or required by law;</li><li>Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding;</li><li>Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request;</li><li>Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;</li><li>Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or</li><li>Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Tap Academy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.</li><li>We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>During a Change in Control</strong>: If Tap Academy undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).</li><li><strong>After Aggregation/De-identification</strong>: we can disclose or use aggregate or de-identified data for any purpose.</li><li><strong>With Your Permission</strong>: with your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><h3>6. Security</h3><p>We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.

These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Tap Academy, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately.</p><h3>7. Your Rights</h3><p>You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain analytics providers. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data such to to restrict our processing of your data, to erase all data we have stored about you, and the right to ask for the data to be provided to you/ported to any other service in a commonly used machine readable format. Parents who believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about their underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.</p><h4>7.1 Your Choices About the Use of Your Data</h4><p>You can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use certain features of the Services</p><ul><li>To stop receiving promotional communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the promotional communication you receive or by changing the email preferences in your account.
