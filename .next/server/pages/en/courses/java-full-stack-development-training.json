Large volumes of data can be organised using Data Structures in a way that makes it possible to quickly and effectively access the data and perform operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. There are numerous types of data structures, each with unique benefits and applications, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Which Data Structure to select for a particular activity will depend on the demands and limitations of the problem at hand. Any computer programmer must have a solid understanding of data structures since they serve as the basis for developing high-performance and scalable software systems.","question":"What is Data Structure?"},{"answer":"The foundation of computer programming is made up of Data Structures and Algorithms, which are essential for creating efficient, scalable, and effective software systems. A programmer may analyse, create, and implement solutions for complex problems in an optimal way by understanding these ideas. Building high-performance applications requires an understanding of data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs as well as algorithms like sorting, searching, and recursion. They are also valuable and in-demand skills for any aspiring programmer or technology worker because they are frequently prerequisites for many advanced computer science and software engineering professions.","question":"Why Data Structures and Algorithms?"},{"answer":"Data Structures can be broadly classified into two types: Linear Data Structures Arrays, linked lists, and stacks are examples of linear data structures, which store data components sequentially. Non-Linear Data Structures On the other hand, non-linear data structures, such trees and graphs, store data pieces in a hierarchical or networked fashion. Selecting the best Data Structure for a particular problem is a crucial part of computer programming since each type of Data Structure has unique use cases and benefits. Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (such as binary trees and B-trees), and graphs are a few of the most widely used data structures (such as directed and undirected graphs).
